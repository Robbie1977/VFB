  <h2>What is a composite permalink and how it works</h2>

	<p>
    A permalink provides a "stable" URL at which the current composite view could be accessed at a later stage, making it possible to share a specific composite view with others. Permalinks are generated with each new browser session.<br/>
     A permalink looks like:  
    http://www.virtualflybrain.org/do/composite_view.html?action=load&uuid=2013-06-13_15.18.49.723.
    </p>

  	<ul>
	  <li>
	  To obtain a permalink to the current composite stack, click the link "Get permalink and start new composite". 
	  A pop-up window will appear asking if you are sure you want to do this. Once you obtain the permalink, that composite will no longer be editable. Click 'OK'. <br/>
	  You can copy the permalink from dialog box that appears. The link may be displayed over more than one line, depending on the browser you use - you need to select all of it (as in example above).
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  Now you can save this link anywhere in a text file or share it via email/facebook/etc.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  Anyone can paste the composite link in a browser address bar to view your composite at any time. (*)  
	  </li>	  
	</ul>
	<h2> Important notes to bear in mind:</h2>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	  (*) Although we do not set a time limit on how long we keep user's composites on our server, we reserve the right to delete old composites should the number of composite stacks 
	  grow too large. Old composites will be removed without prior warning to the composite owner.   
	  </li>	  
	  <li>
	  Do note that obtaining a permalink means that you can no longer edit the composite view.           
	  </li>
	 </ul>
