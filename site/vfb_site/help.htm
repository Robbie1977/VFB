  <h2>General usage of the Stack Viewer</h2>
  	<ul>
	  <li>
	  Mouse-over a region in the central-window, which shows the stack, to show the name of that region.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  Double-click on a region of the stack to select it. Selected regions are colour-highlighted. Any associated information with that region is displayed in the lower window. You can select as many regions as you like. The lower window displays information for the last selected region.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  Select a term in the anatomy tree window on the right to see the corresponding region colour-highlighted in the stack. You can select as many regions as you like.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  Clicking 'centre' next to a term in the anatomy tree changes the view of the stack, centering it on that region. This centered view will be maintained if the plane of view (frontal, horizontal, sagittal or others) is subsequently changed.       
	  </li>	  
	  <li>
	  Using the controls found to the left of the stack, the image can be arbitrarily rotated, zoomed, or observed in the X-, Y- and Z-axes. Pre-selected planes of view for frontal, horizontal and sagittal orientations are also provided as options.
	  </li>	  
	  <li>
	  Use the search box at the top of the anatomy tree to quickly locate structures of interest. The box provides auto-complete functionality. When the region of interest is found, hit "Enter" - the tree will expand to show the searched term, and the information for this term will be displayed in the lower-window.       
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  Use the "Show all Domains/Clear all Selections" option, found below the search box, to quickly view/clear all selected regions in the stack. Clicking "Clear all Selections" also collapses the tree to the default initial state.           
	  </li>	  
	  <li>
	  To access to the queries menu for that region, look for the 'Query for' menu bar on the top of the term info window. To see the options available for each of the query menus to the right of 'Query for', hover the mouse over each one. Using this menu, the user can choose to search for: neurons (specifying the type of synaptic terminals) or images of single neurons, or tracts that innervate that region.  Search options for transgenes and genes expressed in the selected region, or phenotypes that affect it are also available.
	  </li>
