	<h2>What is Virtual Fly Brain?</h2>

<h2>What is Virtual Fly Brain?</h2>

	<p>
		Welcome to Virtual Fly Brain (VFB) - an interactive tool for neurobiologists to explore the detailed neuroanatomy,
		gene expression, and associated phenotypes of the adult <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> brain. <br />
		Our goal is to make it easier for researchers to find relevant anatomical information and reagents. We integrate the neuroanatomical data and expression from the published literature and image datasets onto the same standard, making it possible to run cross searches and comparisons.
	</p>
	<h1 style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: normal">
		The VFB <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> fly brain atlas was developed in accordance with BrainName's standard nomenclature.

	<h2>The 3D Brain Viewer and Query Tools</h2>

	<p>The <a href="site/stacks/index.htm">Brain Viewer</a> is an interactive, configurable application that allows the user to view and explore
		the adult fruit fly brain anatomy in terms of known Drosophila brain neuropils. 
	  </p>
	<p>
	  The viewer's central window features a 2D representation of an adult brain that can be viewed along the x-, y- and
		z-axes, rotated and zoomed, and shows neuropil domains as colour-coded overlays. Domains can be selected by double-clicking on the stack or by selecting them on the interactive anatomy tree on the right panel (left click). The tree can be simply browsed, or terms can be directly searched by using the search box above the tree. More information about the last selected term (on the stack or on the tree) will be displayed in the lower panel, the term info window. 
	</p>
	<p>
	       Searching for neurons, innervation patterns, gene and transgene expression and phenotypes associated to a brain neuropil, is possible by right/control clicking on the term in the tree or on the term info window. </p>

	<p>
	  Searches for individual neuron images is also possible, with result lists displaying relevant neurons, divided into groups of morphologically similar neurons (tool developed by Gregory Jefferis, Division of Neurobiology, MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology). Currently, 16132 images of single neurons from the Flycircuit dataset can be searched on the site. We thank the group of A.S. Chiang for taking the lead in making their raw image data available.

	</p>
	<p>* The brain stack currently used for the viewer was kindly provided by Arnim Jenett of HHMI Janelia Farm research campus, and by Kei Ito and Kazunori Shinomiya of Tokyo University.</p>

	<p> The <a href="site/tools/anatomy_finder/index.htm">Anatomy/Neuron Finder</a> tool allows searching for information associated with any neuropil domain or neuron.</p>

	<p>The interactive <a href="site/tools/query_builder/index.htm">Query Builder</a> allows the building and execution of more complex queries that may include
		multiple anatomy terms with differing properties. It allows searching for neurons that connect two different brain regions, specifying the directionality of these connections. </p>

	<h2>Supported Browsers</h2>
	<p>
		We are working hard to ensure that the viewer works well in all major browsers and operating systems. Your experience will be best when using well 
		tested browser/OS, so please refer to the table below to find out the level of browser/OS compatibility we currently offer:
