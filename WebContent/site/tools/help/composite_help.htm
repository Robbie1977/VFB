<h2>Generating a composite view</h2>
  <ul>
  <li> You can build a composite view from different images stacks which have been integrated on the site. Clicking on "See in viewer" from any image stack to see that image in the Viewer. Together with the image stack, any neuropil domain can be highlighted on the brain stack.
  </li>
  <li> On this page, you can see which stacks have been added, and delete them.
  </li>
  <li>Each composite view is associated to a permanent URL, permalink, which you can share with others.
  </li>
<li>
Permalinks are generated with each new browser session.<br/>
 A permalink looks like:  
http://www.virtualflybrain.org/do/composite_view.html?action=load&uuid=2013-06-13_15.18.49.723.
</li>
	  <li>
	  To obtain a permalink to the current composite stack, click the link "Get permalink and start new composite". 
	  A pop-up window will appear asking if you are sure you want to do this. Once you obtain the permalink, that composite will no longer be editable. Click 'OK'. <br/>
	  You can copy the permalink from the dialog box that appears. The link may be displayed over more than one line, depending on the browser you use - you need to select all of it (as in example above).
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  Now you can save this link anywhere in a text file or share it via email/facebook/etc.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  Anyone can paste the composite link in a browser address bar to view your composite at any time. (*)  
	  </li>	  
	</ul>
	<h2> Important notes to bear in mind:</h2>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	  (*) Although we do not set a time limit on how long we keep user's composites on our server, we reserve the right to delete old composites should the number of composite stacks 
	  grow too large. Old composites will be removed without prior warning to the composite owner.   
	  </li>	  
	  <li>
	  Do note that obtaining a permalink means that you can no longer edit the composite view.           
	  </li>
	 </ul>
